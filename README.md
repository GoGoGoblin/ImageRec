# ImageRec
Image Recognition Automation using Google Cloud Vision API

This Python program reads all image files in a designated directory of a local PC. Then, it sends a POST request to Google Cloud Vision API and receives a label of the image recognised by Google Cloud Vision. The file names and returned labels are stored in a CSV file (label.csv).
